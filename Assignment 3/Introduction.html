		<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:140%;">
		AI is an area of computer science of making intelligent machines that emphasizes the creation of them that react like humans. Some of the activities computers with artificial intelligence are designed for include:
		<ul style="font-size:140%;">
		<li> Speech recognition	</li>
		<li> Learning </li>
		<li> Planning </li>
		<li> Problem-Solving </li>
		</ul>

		<b style="font-size:150%;"><h3 style="text-align:center"> Beating the World Champion of GO </h3></b>
		<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:140%;">In 2016, Google DeepMind’s AI software AlphaGo was the first computer program to defeat a professional human Go player and is arguably the strongest Go player in history.

		<b style="font-size:150%;"><h3 style="text-align:center"> Dominating Atari games </h3></b>
		<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:140%;">
		Old Atari games used to be extremely fun for humans, but we never really managed to dominate them like the way AI has recently done. DeepMind – a London-based AI company acquired by Google in 2014 – was recently presented with a few classic Atari games. At first, Google’s DeepMind was not great but lately it started to play better than any human ever did. </p>
