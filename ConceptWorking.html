<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:140%; font-style: italic;">
The picture above has illustrated the concept of work behind most common virtual  assistants. User  will  use  device  like  smartphones,  AlexaEchos,...  to  use  the  interface.   User can  speak  to  virtual  assistant (Siri, Alexa)  or  text  to  it.   All  the  information  the  user  has provided will be transferred to the NLP Part, which stands for Natural  Language  Processing.   In  this  stage,  the  information  will  be processed, analysed by the machine.  Then the machine will get the corresponding information from the Knowledge base and respond (in the case of userâ€™s asking question) or give out instructions to otherpart to perform a task (if user tell the virtual assistant to perform a job).
</p>
<p style= "font-style: italic;">
From the above explanation, NLP (Natural Language Processing) is considered to be the workhorse of the any common virtual assistant.   In  addition,  NLP  is  built  with  the  help  of  Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

<div>
<p>Artificial neural networks(ANN) are computing system that are inspired  by, but not  identical to, biological neural networks that constitutes animal brains.</p>

<p>
The two pictures illustrate some similarities of two types of neural network. From figure (b), cell body (often referred as the node or unit, which is the basic unit of ANN) receives input data such as x<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>, ...,x<sub>n</sub> and some weights w<sub>0</sub>, w<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>, ..., w<sub>n</sub>. Those input data and weights are calculated, accumulated, summed up, applied function <i>f</i> on the data and yield out the result.  Similar to biological neural network,from figure (a), in which the input data here will be the impulses carried in and the result is the impulses carried out.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
The idea that makes artificial neural network performs nearly like the biological neural network is that the weights <i>w</i> is learnable and control the strength of influence and its direction: excitory (positiveweight) or inhibitory (negative weight).
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>From the above explanation, we can conclude that ANN is composed of the following components:
<ul  style="text-align:justify; font-size:140%;line-height: 1.3;" >
<li><b>Input Nodes (input  layer)</b>: No computation is done here within the layer, they just simply pass the information to the next layer.</li>
<li><b>Hidden  Nodes(hidden  layer):</b> In this layer, intermediate processing or computation is done, they perform computations and then  transfer the weights from the input layer to next layer (which will the next hidden layer or output layer). There is sometimes possible that ANN does not have hidden layer</li>
<li> <b>Output Nodes (out layer):</b> Use activation function that maps to the desired output format.</li>
<li><b>Connection and weights:</b> Connections transfer the output of  1  node  to  the  input  of  another  node.   Each  connection  is assigned  with  the  weight.   For  example,  connection  between node i and node j has the weight w<sub>ij</sub></li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-size: 150% ;margin-left: 5%;">a. Feedforward Neutral Network:</h3>
<div>
<div>
<p>(a) <b>Single-layer Perceptron</b> No hidden layer. Weights and Inputs are directly put into node, which yield out the result.

</p>
<p>(b) <b>Multi-layer Perceptron(MLP)</b> This class of networks consists of multiple layers of computational units, usually interconnected in a feed-forward way.  Each neuron in one layer has directed connections to the neurons of the subsequent layer.

<p>(c) <b>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</b> In neural networks, Convolutional neural network (CNNs) is one of the main categories to do images recognition, images classifications.  Objects detections, recognition faces etc., are some of the areas where CNNs are widely used.

<div><p>
In recurrent neural network (RNN), connections between units form a directed cycle (they propagate data forward, but also backwards, from later processing stages to earlier stages).
