# FULL TEST

Your part(which is the HTML file) is good enough after the unit tests.

In the "concat_html_files.php", add your file there in the php script.

## USE REPL.IT to full test

Open repl.it and choose PHP web server, in the edit workspace, drag all your projects there.

Then edit the index.php created by repl.it and include the web_of_the_world/concat_html_files.php
