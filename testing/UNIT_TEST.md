# UNIT TEST

For the unit test, here is the way to do it.

Each member make html file and do research on the things they are assigned to do.

After making the HTML file, check the HTML performance in your own web broswer(Simply clicking on the HTML file).

If you are sure with the HTML file you are having, upload it to github and don't forget to pull request it, which I will have to make it clear to you somedays soon.
